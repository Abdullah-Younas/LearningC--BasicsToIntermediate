Hello World!
this was the first line I written in C++ during my 10th Grade and I fell in love with it. I just used C++ for a Week at that time to make a Proj after that I never re learned it again.
Learning C++ is my Goal since I love games.
So I started Learning C++ again 2 weeks before.
I learnt a lot of things in that Time Period.
**Variables**
**Syntax**
**Functions**
**For Loops**
**While Loops**
**Classes**
**Arrays**
**Vectors**
**OOP**
**Structs**
**Pointer Basics**
So I love it I love C++. I know a lot of people say that they hate it and I agree with them that its difficult to understand,Write but when you have a GOAL in mind Like me You will Love it.
So yeah That's It,
BYE.
